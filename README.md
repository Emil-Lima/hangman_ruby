Hangman terminal game using Ruby, importing the word to guess from an external file and with the option to save game and load a preexisting game.

Things left to be done in this project:

1. Add either a name generator (Can be with numbers (from 1 to infinity)) or a function that lets the user select the name of the file when they select to save file.

2. Add a function that deletes the file of the current game when the game ends (victory or defeat) if the current game was loaded (not new game).

3. Add a function to check the user inputs when selecting a letter.

4. Add a function to check that the user selects either "l" (load) or "n" (new) when starting the game.

5. Add a function to check that the user selects either "s" (save) or "c" (continue) when asked to save or continue the game.
